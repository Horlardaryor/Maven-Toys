/* Project Overview: Sales & Inventory Analysis for Maven Toys

In my capacity as a data analyst, my capstone project was centered around the examination of sales and inventory data for Maven Toys, a fictitious chain of toy stores located in Mexico. The primary aim of this project was to glean valuable insights pertaining to product profitability, inventory management, and the repercussions of product stockouts on sales. With a professional tone, the following provides a comprehensive overview of the project:

Data Scope:
This project entailed the meticulous analysis of extensive sales and inventory data, encompassing intricate details about the products, store locations, daily sales transactions, and the prevailing inventory levels at each of the Maven Toys outlets. This dataset proved to be an invaluable resource, offering a wealth of information for comprehensive analysis and informed decision-making.

Objective:
The core objective of this project revolved around addressing pivotal business queries and furnishing actionable insights aimed at bolstering profitability, streamlining inventory levels, and mitigating sales losses arising from product unavailability.

Methodology:
To effectively fulfill the project objectives, I employed SQL queries and data analysis techniques to extract and decipher meaningful patterns from the sales and inventory dataset. The analysis focused on providing answers to the following critical inquiries:

Product Category Profitability:
By utilizing SQL queries and conducting pertinent calculations, I identified the product categories that contributed the most to Maven Toys' profits. Additionally, I delved into whether these lucrative product categories were consistent across all store locations or if certain outlets exhibited distinct profit-driving categories.

Inventory Assessment:
In order to gauge the capital tied up in inventory, I computed the overall value of inventory across all Maven Toys stores. Taking into account the average daily sales and inventory levels, I ascertained the duration for which the current inventory could sustain operations. This analysis yielded valuable insights into inventory turnover and efficiency.

Impact of Stockouts on Sales:
Employing SQL queries and sales transaction data, I conducted an exhaustive examination to determine if sales were being adversely affected by product unavailability at specific Maven Toys locations. By identifying instances of product stockouts and closely scrutinizing the corresponding sales data, I quantified the financial ramifications and recommended strategies to curtail sales losses.

Conclusion:
The sales and inventory analysis conducted for Maven Toys yielded invaluable insights into product profitability, inventory management, and the consequences of stockouts on sales. The findings of this project empowered Maven Toys to make well-informed decisions aimed at enhancing profitability, optimizing inventory levels, and ensuring customer satisfaction by minimizing lost sales arising from product unavailability.

In summary, this project underscored the pivotal role of data analysis in bolstering strategic decision-making for Maven Toys. It provided the company with the means to implement data-driven enhancements to its sales and inventory management processes, thus contributing to the organization's overall success.*/
